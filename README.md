# SSChat---A-Messaging-App

SSChat is an Android application that clones WhatsApp, which is created for one-to-one messaging, audio, and video calling services using Kotlin, ZeegoCloud, and Cloud Firestore.

It was built to increase my knowledge about Firebase's real-time database and was inspired by a Youtube playlist.
